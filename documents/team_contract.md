# Team Contract

## Communication
1. **Team Meetings** 
    
    Meetings will occur twice a week on Saturday and Thursday. We will use the Discord application to collaborate and have most of our meetings. On Thursday's we will meet in person.
2. **Assistance** 

    Our team plans to be extremely communicative. We plan to contact eachother with any ideas or issues within a day of them arising. The rest of our team expects to respond to these messages within a day as well.

3. **Respect** 

    To ensure that every member feels like their opinion is being taken into account, we will have a segment at the start of each of our meetings where every member can go around and say how they feel about the state of the project or themselves. In the case that a member cannot make it to a meeting, they will update on this information in the Discord.
    
    
## Collaboration

4. **Work Distribution** 

    We will assign workloads based on individual knowledge and tasks. Each member will have a specific goal to work on for the project, and once every individual completes their work, we will all collectively integrate each segment together. We will ensure to identify the strengths and desires of each team member when distributing work.
    

5. **Time Commitment** 

    Each week, we expect to work on the project for 2-4 hours, however, this does not need to be achieved in one sitting. Everyone should take a look at their code on a daily basis, even if that means just briefly viewing the code. This way, everyone is on the same page in regards to workflow. We have accounted for everyones prior time commitments, and have been communicating about upcoming exams/club deadlines so there will not be very much conflict at all.
    
6. **Conflict Resolution** 

    As stated before, we have accounted for everyones prior time commitments, and have been communicating about upcoming exams/club deadlines so there will not be very much conflict at all. If there is a conflict, we will discuss as a group on a Discord call. In the case that the conflict becomes much bigger, we will loop our mentor in the conversation.
