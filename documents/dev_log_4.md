# Development Log (Date: 11/19/22 -- 12/2/22)

## Weekly Goals

*Add more details on our README file
*Create the make file
*Read our dataset csv and obtain the data to add onto our graph
*Create adjacency matrix from the data set
*Begin method to add vertices and edges on the graph
*Finish the BFS traversal

## Specific Tasks Completed (and by who)

*Update README file with relevent details on how to run the code: Justin
*Create the Makefile: Hayden
*Read our dataset csv and put it into a 2d vector of strings: Justin
*Use 2d vector to make adjacency matrix from the data set: Eisha
*Begin method to add vertices and edges on the graph: Justin, Eisha
*Finish BFS Traversal: Hayden
*Write test cases for BFS traversal: Hayden
*Write test cases for reading data and making adj matrix: Jason
*Verify BFS Traversal with test cases: Hayden
*Verify other algorithms (reading data and making adj matrix) with test cases: Jason
*Prepare what to demo for mid-semester presentation: Hayden, Justin, Jason, Eisha
*Fill out mid-semester PL report: Hayden, Eisha

## Problems Encountered 
Justin encountered an issue while trying to read the csv file into the 2d vector. For some reason, the compiler stated that reading the file as an ifstream was invalid. However, Justin was able to get this resolved with some code modifications. Hayden also ran into a small issue, as his BFS traversal was not passing one of the test cases. This is being worked on now.

## Plans for next week
*Continue to update the README file more
*Convert adjacency matrix to adjacency list representation as well
*Finish algorithm to add verticies and edges in
*Create algorithm to draw edges between verticies based on thresholds met
*Create algorithm to change hue of edges based on thresholds met
*Fix BFS traversal
*Write more supporting test cases


## Optional: Questions for mentor
