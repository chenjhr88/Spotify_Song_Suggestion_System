# Development Log (Date: 11/11/22 -- 11/18/22)

## Weekly Goals
Our Goals for this week was to:
*Break up the work (who's going to work on what) (completed)
*Complete the layout for BFS traversal (completed)
*Have a basic foundation for our graph (structs for vertices, edges, and class for the graph) completed

## Specific Tasks Completed (and by who)
*Figure out which functions each person should work on: Justin, Hayden, Jason, Eisha
*Created basic foundation for graph structure: Hayden
*Developed layout of BFS traversal code for graph: Hayden
*Made layout for creating the addVertices function: Justin
*Made layout for adding edges to graph: Eisha
*research and pseudocode for helper functions to read through csv file: Jason
*Researched/noted other resources for graph development of similar styles: Eisha

## Problems Encountered 
No problems have been encountered yet.

## Plans for next week
*Add more details on our README file
*Create the make file
*Read our dataset csv and obtain the data to add onto our graph
*Be able to add vertices and edges on the graph
*Finish the BFS traversal

## Optional: Questions for mentor
